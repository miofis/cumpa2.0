# Contributing

## Branching model
- `master` is the main branch.
- everything you work on should be associated to a ticket in the Github project, so it has an issue number associated.
- whenever you start to work on a new ticket, branch from `master` (update your local branch beforehand) and name the branch `issue-X` where `X` is the issue number associated to the ticket.
- once your work is ready, create a pull request from `issue-X` to `master` and assign [@goodengineer](https://github.com/goodengineer) for code review.

## Pull requests
- at some point there will be automatic checks, but for now make sure that all tests are passing by the time you assign a reviewer.
